A distributed, fault tolerant scheduler database that can potentially scale to millions of jobs. 

The idea is to build it with a storage layer based on B+tree or LSM-tree implementation, consistent hashing for load balancing, and raft for consensus.

## üéØ Quick start

```bash
# Start 3 nodes. Create respective data folders 
# as data/node1/data and data/node1/raft
./create-cluster.sh 3

# To add node2 to node1 as to form cluster
‚ùØ curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8001/cluster/join' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
 "node_id":"node2",
 "raft_address":"localhost:8102"
}'
# Do the same thing to node3.

# To check cluster health of 3 nodes
‚ùØ ./check-health.sh 3

# More scripts coming soon
```
